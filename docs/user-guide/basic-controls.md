# Basic Controls
This section explains how to operate the keys to control propulsion (airspeed and RPM) and flight control surfaces (heading and attitude, altitude) of the aircraft.

---

## Propulsion Controls
The keys and methods for the throttle to control the output power of the aircraft such as speed and engine RPM are as follows.

| Key | Action | Note |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `E`            | Increase **Throttle** (up to 1) | Air speed and RPM increase faster with long press |
| `D`            | Decrease **Throttle** (down to 0) | Air speed and RPM decrease faster with long press |
| `C`            | Cut and idle **Throttle** | Press once to set the throttle value to zero |
| `B`            |  Brake on ground | Acts on landing gear brake pads |

 
## Flight Controls
The keys and methods for controlling each flight control surface and trim for Aileron, Elevator, and Rudder as Primary Control and Flap as Secondary Control are as follows.

### Primary Flight Control Surfaces
The control keys for each Aileron, Elevator, and Rudder, which are the control surfaces of the aircraft that control the aircraft's heading and attitude, such as bank, pitch, and yaw, are as follows.


| Key | Action | Note |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Num pad `4` and `6`            | **Aileron** Left and Right | Bank (rolling), x-axis direction control (left/right during flight)  |
| Num pad `2` and `8`           | **Elevator** Up and Down | Pitching, z-axis direction control |
| Num pad `7` and `9`           | **Rudder** Left and Right | Yawing, z-axis direction control (left/right on the ground) |
| Num pad `5`        | **Aileron** and **Rudder** to stabilized position | |
| `Space`        | **Elevator** to stabilized position | |


### Secondary Flight Control Surfaces
The control keys for Flaps that generate high lift by changing the shape of the main wing are as follows.


| Key | Action | Note |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `R`            | **Flap** 0 stage | Positioned at flap 0 degree in any section  |
| `F`            | **Flap** retract 1 step |  |
| `V`            | **Flap** extract 1 step |  |


### Trim Flight Control Surfaces
The trim keys for each fine attitude adjustment of Aileron, Elevator, and Rudder are as follows.

| Key | Action | Note |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `T`            | Trim the **Elevator** down | Fine adjust the pitch of the elevator down |
| `G`            | Trim the **Elevator** up | Fine adjust the pitch of the elevator up | 
| `Y`            | Trim the **Aileron** to the right  | Fine adjust the bank of aileron to the right |
| `H`            | Trim the **Aileron** to the left  | Fine adjust the bank of aileron to the left |
| `U`            | Trim the **Rudder** to the right  | Fine adjust the yaw of rudder to the right |
| `H`            | Trim the **Rudder** to the left  | Fine adjust the yaw of rudder to the left 
 
## Other Controls
The keys to operate the control mode, viewpoint and location of the aircraft in the simulator are as follows.

| Key | Action |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `I`            | Return the aircraft to its original spawn point| |
| `Q`            | Toggel between keyboard and joystick in **Manual Control Mode** |
| **Right-click + Drag ** | Adjust Aircraft View Orientation |
| **Mouse wheel scrolls up and down ** | Zooming in and out of the simulator screen |
