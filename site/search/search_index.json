Customize event order for plugin event handlers (#2973) \uf0c1 Plugins can now choose to set a priority value for their event handlers. This can override the old behavior where for each event type, the handlers are called in the order that their plugins appear in the plugins config . If this is set, events with higher priority are called first. Events without a chosen priority get a default of 0. Events that have the same priority are ordered as they appear in the config. Recommended priority values: 100 \"first\", 50 \"early\", 0 \"default\", -50 \"late\", -100 \"last\". As different plugins discover more precise relations to each other, the values should be further tweaked. See documentation . New events that persist across builds in mkdocs serve (#2972) \uf0c1 The new events are on_startup and on_shutdown . They run at the very beginning and very end of an mkdocs invocation. on_startup also receives information on how mkdocs was invoked (e.g. serve --dirtyreload ). See documentation . Replace File.src_path to not deal with backslashes (#2930) \uf0c1 The property src_path uses backslashes on Windows, which doesn't make sense as it's a virtual path. To not make a breaking change, there's no change to how this property is used, but now you should: Use File.src_uri instead of File.src_path and File.dest_uri instead of File.dest_path . See more examples in documentation . Updated: config_options.SubConfig (#2807) \uf0c1 SubConfig used to silently ignore all validation of its config options. Now you should pass validate=True to it or just use new class-based configs where this became the default. So, it can be used to validate a nested sub-dict with all keys pre-defined and value types strictly validated. See examples in documentation .

Replace File.src_path to not deal with backslashes (#2930) \uf0c1 The property src_path uses backslashes on Windows, which doesn't make sense as it's a virtual path. To not make a breaking change, there's no change to how this property is used, but now you should: Use File.src_uri instead of File.src_path and File.dest_uri instead of File.dest_path . See more examples in documentation . Updated: config_options.SubConfig (#2807) \uf0c1 SubConfig used to silently ignore all validation of its config options. Now you should pass validate=True to it or just use new class-based configs where this became the default. So, it can be used to validate a nested sub-dict with all keys pre-defined and value types strictly validated. See examples in documentation .

This can override the old behavior where for each event type, the handlers are called in the order that their plugins appear in the plugins config . If this is set, events with higher priority are called first. Events without a chosen priority get a default of 0. Events that have the same priority are ordered as they appear in the config. Recommended priority values: 100 \"first\", 50 \"early\", 0 \"default\", -50 \"late\", -100 \"last\". As different plugins discover more precise relations to each other, the values should be further tweaked.
