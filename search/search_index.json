Concept and Key Features \uf0c1 MORAI SIM: Air is a simulation platform that can verify autonomous flight systems used in various industries such as Urban Air Mobility (UAM), unmanned aerial vehicles (Drones), and light aircraft in a virtual environment. MORAI SIM: Air provides a variety of real flight environments as virtual simulations using Digital Twin technology, so the safety of the aircraft can be verified more efficiently and accurately. And it reporduces actual flight facilities such as vertical take-off and landing facilities (vertiport) and airports for vehicle verification as a digital twin environment, and simulates the actual measurement data provided to the aircraft from each facility as it is. MORAI SIM: Air virtualizes various sensors and flight dynamics model (FDM) specialized for the aviation industry, and can transmit and receive data in real-time by applying communication such as ROS2 and UDP . The main features of MORAI SIM: Air are as follows.

Supported communication method \uf0c1 MORAI SIM: Air supports UDP and ROS2 for network communication between the simulator and external systems. UDP is a widely used network protocol for transmitting data over the internet, while ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a popular middleware for robotics and automation applications. The MORAI SIM: Air simulator allows for sending sensor data and receiving aircraft control messages using either UDP or ROS2 communication methods. To communicate with MORAI SIM: Air, Depending on the simulator's message transmission/reception method, the following network settings are required. Figure 1. Network communication method supported by MORAI SIM: Air MORAI SIM: Air sends sensor data to an external system UDP Network Settings in each sensor model in the simulator Receive UDP messages and publish to ROS2 using UDP to ROS2 Bridge MORAI SIM: Air receives aircraft control messages from an external system UDP Network Settings provided by the simulator (Subscriber IP/Port setting) Subscribe to ROS2 messages and them over UDP using UDP to ROS2 Bridge The UDP to ROS2 Bridge serves to connect data between the UDP-based simulator and the ROS2 system by receiving and transmitting UDP signals and issuing and subscribing to ROS2 as shown below. Figure 2. Role of 'UDP to ROS2 Bridge' \u26a0\ufe0f WARNING The current simulator does not provide direct support for transmitting/receiving ROS2 messages. Therefore, UDP to ROS2 Bridge should be used for ROS2 communication with an external system. Receiving Aircraft Control Messages \uf0c1 When the simulator receives control messages by ROS2 communication, Configure the ROS2 to UDP communication environment and set the network of the simulator in the order below. Step 1: Subscribe to ROS2 messages \uf0c1 For this step, you need to install and run UDP to ROS2 Bridge . \u2705 TIPS See the guide provided separately. Step 2: UDP network setting in the simulator \uf0c1 1) Activate the network menu \uf0c1 Click Network in the top left menu as shown below. 2) Configure Host IP/Port \uf0c1 The method of receiving aircraft control messages in the simulator consists of Ghost Mode and External Ctrl protocol. \u2705 TIPS For the message type and detailed structure received in each Ghost Mode and External Ctrl, see here guide Configure the Host IP/Port as below to operate the aircraft in ghost mode by receiving external control messages. Host IP: Enter the IP of the host PC running the simulator Host Port: Enter the Port of Host PC Host IP/Port configuration method for External Ctrl protocol is the same as above. 3) Network connection \uf0c1 Click Connect at the bottom of each PROTOCOL_SUB_GHOSTMODE and PROTOCOL_SUB_EXTERNALCTRL . Then, it enters into a standby state in which a control message can be received. Sending Sensor Messages \uf0c1 Step 1: Senosr network setting in the simulator \uf0c1 1) Place sensors on the aircraft \uf0c1 \u2705 TIPS For details on how to place the sensor, see the sensor setting guide part. 2) Configure Destination IP/Port \uf0c1 Configure Destination IP/Port for UDP network in Network Settings at the bottom of the sensor setting window. Destination IP and Port : Enter the IP and port of the target server that transmits sensor data in the simulator. In case of ROS2 communication in the server, enter the IP and Port of the server where UDP to ROS2 Bridge is installed. 3) Network connection \uf0c1 Click Connect at the bottom of Network Settings .
