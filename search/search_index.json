Customize event order for plugin event handlers (#2973) \uf0c1 Plugins can now choose to set a priority value for their event handlers. This can override the old behavior where for each event type, the handlers are called in the order that their plugins appear in the plugins config . If this is set, events with higher priority are called first. Events without a chosen priority get a default of 0. Events that have the same priority are ordered as they appear in the config. Recommended priority values: 100 \u201cfirst\u201d, 50 \u201cearly\u201d, 0 \u201cdefault\u201d, -50 \u201clate\u201d, -100 \u201clast\u201d.

Replace File.src_path to not deal with backslashes (#2930) \uf0c1 The property src_path uses backslashes on Windows, which doesn\u2019t make sense as it\u2019s a virtual path.
